    <h3>Version 3.2.0</h3>
    <li>Minor: New event rowGroupOpened, for when row groups are opened / closed.</li>
    <li>Minor: Bug fix - pinning was not saved during columnApi.getState()</li>
    <li>Minor: Added 'typings' to package.json, so TypeScript can pick up typings from node module</li>
    <li>Minor: groupDefaultExpanded must be number (used to be number or boolean). Set to -1 instead of 'true' for same effect.</li>
    <li>Minor: addVirtualRowListener - now takes an event type and a function, so has similar pattern to normal event listeners.</li>
    <li>Minor: New method 'destroy' added to custom filters. If you need to do cleanup, put it in the destroy method.</li>
    <li>Minor: Took out 'agGridGlobalFunc()', should use ag.grid.Grid() instead.</li>

    <h3>Version 3.1.2</h3>
    <li>Minor: New column API methods: getLeftDisplayedColumnGroups(), getCenterDisplayedColumnGroups(), getRightDisplayedColumnGroups(), getAllDisplayedColumnGroups()</li>

    <h3>Version 3.1.1</h3>

    <li>Minor: Added 'columnSeparator' to CSV Export</li>
    <li>Minor: Added starting character of '\ufeff' to CSV Export (for Excel compatibility)</li>
    <li>Minor: Bug fix - gridOptions.isEnableSorting && colDef.suppressSorting were not used in 3.1.0, fixed.</li>

    <h3>Version 3.1.0</h3>

    <li>Minor: New <i>allColumns</i> property for export to csv</li>
    <li>Minor: API method <i>deselectNode()</i> now takes <i>'suppressEvents'</i> parameter.</li>
    <li>Minor: Now <i>colDef.field</i> can had deep references, eg colDef.field = 'owner.firstName' </li>
    <li>Minor: New event <i>gridSizeChanged</i>, gets fired when grid changes size, due to window resize or other application state change. Useful if you want to lay out the grid, eg call api.sizeColumnsToFit()</li>
    <li>Minor: Bug fix - since v3 columnDefs was mandatory and threw error if missing. Is now optional again.</li>
    <li>Major: Implemented auto-size for column. Now columns can be told to fit their content.</li>
    <li>Minor: New property: suppressParentsInRowNodes - if you don't want parents in the row node tree structure.</li>
    <li>Minor: Fixed up placement of menu icon, it was hitting the header border.</li>
    <li>Major: Rows can have variable heights with new getRowHeight() callback.</li>
    <li>Minor: bugfix - setColState was not restoring 'visible' correctly</li>
    <li>Minor: New APi - columnApi.resetState()</li>
    <li>Major: Implemented column header templates</li>

    <h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

    <p>
        Version 3 is a major version and has breaking changes. Where possible, the grid will hint if you are using an old property.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Major: Grouping of headers is now called 'columnGrouping' and can now take multiple levels of groups.</li>
    <li>Major: Pinning can now be done on the left and right, previously was just the right.</li>
    <li>Major: Row pivoting is now called row grouping. So the two types of grouping are now called Row Grouping and Column Grouping. Pivoting was taken out as it wasn't true pivoting. The was done to allow true pivoting to happen in a future release and avoid any name clashes.</li>
    <li>Major: gridOptions.groupKeys and gridOptions.groupAggFields are now gone. These were duplicated ways of setting rowGroups and rowAggregation. The correct (and only non-duplicated way) is to use colDef.rowGroupIndex and colDef.aggFunc.</li>
    <li>Major: New Column API method setColumnPinned().</li>
    <li>Major: api.refreshPivot() now called api.refreshRowGroup()</li>
    <li>Major: Event EVENT_COLUMN_PINNED_COUNT_CHANGED removed and EVENT_COLUMN_PINNED added.</li>
    <li>Major: Column getState() and setState() now include pinned state.</li>
    <li>Major: Header Height is now height per row, so if 25, and three column groups, total header height is 3x25 = 75. Before it was total header height (so height was split evenly across the header rows)</li>
    <li>Major: gridOptions.groupHeaders is no longer a property, as grouping in the headers is now defined inside the column definitions.</li>
    <li>Minor: CSS Classes ag-header-cell-grouped and ag-header-cell-not-grouped are no longer used.</li>
    <li>Major: colDef.headerGroupShow is now called colDef.columnGroupShow.</li>
    <li>Major: Icons {headerGroupOpened, headerGroupClosed} now called {columnGroupOpened, columnGroupClosed}</li>
    <li>Major: Column API - columnGroupOpened() renamed to setColumnGroupOpened()</li>
    <li>Major: setColumnVisible(key) now takes a 'key' which can be a colId, field, ColDef object or Column object - previously you had to provide a Column object. Also new method setColumnsVisible(listOfKeys) for updating batches of columns.</li>
    <li>Major: New methods setColumnPinned(key) and setColumnsPinned(listOfKeys) - behave similar to previously mentioned 'visible' methods</li>
    <li>Major: In get/set column state, pivotIndex is now called rowGroupIndex</li>
    <li>Major: If doing raw Javascript version, then angularGridGlobalFunction() is now deprecated, use "new ag.grid.Grid()" method instead.</li>
    <li>Major: checkboxSelection (on colDef) can now be a function, so you can use params in the function
        to work out at runtime if the cell should have a checkbox. gridOptions now also has function of the same
        name, so you can configure the grid to have a checkbox in the first column always regardless of the colDef
        (this is what the test drive does).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 2.3.7</h3>
    <li>Minor: Updated AngularJS 2 to version Beta 0. Example updated to show changes.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.5</h3>
    <li>Minor: Overlays can now be disabled via new properties suppressLoadingOverlay and suppressNoRowsOverlay.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.4</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Template cache now working with IE9</li>
    <li>Bug fix: forEachNodeAfterFilter and forEachNodeAfterFilterAndSort were not working properly when grouping.</li>
    <li>Minor: Now set filter can take a comparator.</li>
    <li>Bug fix: Was not possible to add event listeners or set attributes to virtual elements after binding. This is now possible.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Setting rowBuffer to zero did not work.</li>
    <li>Bug fix: Export to csv was not managing large exports.</li>
    <li>Minor: Moved Angular 2 examples to alpha 44.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: 'no rows' overlay was blocking column headers, so if showing, couldn't change filter.</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.1</h3>
    <li>Bug fix: Angular 2 - EventEmitter for rowDeselected was missing.</li>
    <li>Major: Added getBusinessKeyForNode() method, to allow easily identifying of rows for automated testing.</li>
    <li>Minor: Removed declaration of 'module' and 'exports' in main.ts, so no longer clashes with node.ts typics.</li>
    <li>Minor: Fixed headerClass, array of classes was not working</li>

    <h3>Version 2.3.0</h3>
    <li>Major - Introduced 'no rows' message for when grid is empty.</li>
    <li>Major - Introduced custom overlays for 'no rows' and 'loading', so now they can be what you like.</li>
    <li>Major - Moved to AngularJS 2 alpha 38.</li>
    <li>Major - Took out auto loading of AngularJS 2 module with JSPM.</li>
    <li>Minor - Exposed global function for initialising Angular 1.x, to use if Angular not available on the global scope, eg using JSPM</li>
    <li>Minor - Bugfix - rowRenderer was not working when useEntireRow=true</li>

    <h3>Version 2.2.0</h3>
    <li>Major - Implemented 'destroy' API method, to release grids resources. Needed for Web Components and native
    Javascript (AngularJS lifecycle manages this for you).</li>
    <li>Major - Column resize events now have 'finished' flag, so if resizing, you know which event from a stream of
    'dragging' events is the final one.</li>
    <li>Major - New event: rowDeselected.</li>
    <li>Major - Now have 'customHeader' and 'customFooter' for export to csv.</li>
    <li>Minor - Now filters are positioned relative to their actual size instead of assuming each filter
                is 200px wide. Now wide filters don't fall off the edge of the grid.</li>
    <li>Minor - Bug fix #459 - getTopLevelNodes was called for not reason during filter initialisation which resulted in 'undefined' error for server side filtering</li>

    <h3>Version 2.1.3</h3>
    <li>Minor - Added header to Typescript definitions file and included in Definitely Typed</li>
    <li>Minor - Removed unused 'require' from agList - was conflicting when require defined elsewhere</li>
