# AngularJS + D3.js = Radian

**Radian** is a JavaScript library for producing interactive SVG plots
in HTML using Angular JS and D3.js.  Using Angular directives leads to
a clear and declarative API for representing plots that can respond to
UI elements via Angular data binding.

Documentation is on the
[website](http://openbrainsrc.github.io/Radian/index.html) (some
technical documentation is also on the
[wiki](https://github.com/glutamate/Radian/wiki).)
