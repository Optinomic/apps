[description]
sql_init: This code is executed when a module is installed and is so in a schema specially created for that module. It means accessing the main tables as to be done by prefixing public. to their name. When returning a view/table/function created in this schema, the API does it with a special user which only has read-only access to the other schemas. This is preventing a module from modifying the API tables but also the tables from other modules.
